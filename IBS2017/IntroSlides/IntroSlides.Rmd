## Paleoecological data and the Neotoma Paleoecology Database
- Paleo data for biogeographers
    - taxon occurrences in space and time
    - taxon attributes
    - paleoenvironmental data
    
## Taxon occurrences:
- [Neotoma Paleoecology Database](www.neotomadb.org) (multiproxy)
- [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/) (PBDB)(multiproxy)
- [NOW database](http://www.helsinki.fi/science/now/) (mammals)
- [PaleoPortal](http://paleoportal.org/index.php?globalnav=doing_paleo&sectionnav=more_submissions&state_id=0&submission_type_id=28&type_id=5&page_num=1) (contains links to several sites)
- [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org/) 
- Others?

## Taxon morphological or functional attributes:
- Sometimes associated with the data in databases (e.g., mammal body size in PBDB)
- [MOM](http://biology.unm.edu/fasmith/Datasets/) (late Quaternary mammal body mass)
- [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/)
- Modern databases (Pantheria, TRY, BIEN, etc)
    
## Paleoenvironmental data:
- CCSM3:
    - Paleo (CCSM3 & ECBilt) to future climate [Lorenz et al. 2016](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201648)
    - Related: [PaleoView](http://www.fordhamlab.com/climate-geography) from the Fordham lab
- HadCM3 from [Singarayer & Valdes, 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379109003564)
- [Worldclim](http://www.worldclim.org/paleo-climate1) (6000 and 22000 ybp, based on CMIP5)
- Others?

## Paleoecological data and the Neotoma Paleoecology Database
- We will discuss attributes of paleo data in the context of Neotoma ([www.neotomadb.org](www.neotomadb.org)), a database that houses different data from the more recent periods of Earth history

## What is Neotoma?
- Neotoma is a database *consortium*: [www.neotomadb.org](www.neotomadb.org)
- Organized around proxy types
    - historically, brought together several major databases or datasets (i.e. FAUNMAP, COHMAP)
    - moving towards direct entry of individual data files
- The different databases use a common, extendable platform to ensure compatibility across proxy types
- Each proxy community can develop own standards, e.g. for taxonomy

## The Neotoma ecosystem
- Faunal data
    - FAUNMAP
    - Other datasets in progress (FAUNMAP2, MIOMAP, ANTIGUA, MQMD):
- Pollen and plant macros
    - North America Pollen Database
    - European Pollen Database
    - Latin American Pollen Database
- Packrat midden database
- Ostracodes, Diatoms
- Isotopes (coming online soon)
- Use `neotoma::get_table("datasettype")` to see all 25 available types

## Scope and strengths of Neotoma
- Pliocene to present, global
- Chronology tools and storage
- Multiproxy
- Active development community
- Curated database --> high quality data

## Curated database
- Each proxy group has a set of data stewards, led by one or a few lead stewards
- Anyone can deposit data into Neotoma
- Before going 'live', data need to be validated by a data steward

## Key elements of paleoecological data
- Fundamental message: user beware. You should understand the **taphonomy** of your study system in order to accurately infer biogeographic patterns across space and time
    - Occurrence records and taxonomy
    - Orienting occurrences in space
    - Orienting occurrences in time
- Some key taphonomy references
    - Behrensmeyer AK, Kidwell S, Gastaldo R. 2000. [Taphonomy and paleobiology.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373(2000)26[103:TAP]2.0.CO;2) Paleobiology. 26(sp4):103–47
    - Jackson ST. 2012. [Representation of flora and vegetation in Quaternary fossil assemblages: known and unknown knowns and unknowns.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.05.020) Quaternary Science Reviews. 49:1–16

## Occurrence records and taxonomy
- Each occurrence is associated with a **taxonomic identification**
- Paleo data are often, though not always, less precise taxonomically than present-day data
- Different proxy types are recorded in different ways
    - Vertebrate data: MNI/NISP/Presence
    - Pollen data: counts per total pollen count, usually converted to relative abundance

## Spatial precision
- lat-long coordinates, similar to present-day data
- **Different proxy types**, different taxa, and different depositional environments **record different levels of spatial precision**
    - Plant macrofossils vs. pollen
    - Cave deposits vs. fluvial deposits

## Example: Fossil pollen from lake sediments
![](images/FossilPollen.jpg)

## Temporal precision
- Every occurrence is associated with an inference about the *time* the organism died
- There are different dating methods, each with their own assumptions and associated strengths and weaknesses
- **Different proxy types and depositional environments will be associated with different amounts of time-averaging**

## Key caveats* 
- Errors or omissions in the data
- Updates to the data may not be stored in the database
    - new dates, changes in taxonomy, etc.
- "Garbage in, garbage out" 
    - Many of the original databases like FAUNMAP and COHMAP convened a group of experts to assess various aspects of data quality. We need to keep applying that same lens to new datasets
    - Data without associated metadata can only go so far
        - *Note*: What is considered "good metadata" changes through time! 
- When in doubt, record and store as much information as possible.

*for Neotoma and all other databases!

## Getting data out of Neotoma
- Neotoma Explorer
- API
- R
- Database snapshots (housed at [www.neotomadb.org/snapshots](www.neotomadb.org/snapshots))

## Major activities
- Adding new data (MIOMAP, ANTIGUA, MQMD)
- Integration with other databases: PBDB/Neotoma cross-database searches
- DOIs: assign datasets individual DOIs (will satisfy NSF data access guidelines)
- Embargos: tools for embargoing data.
    - will allow users to enter and validate data, get a DOI for paper submission, then data go 'live' when the paper is published
- Governance and Sustainability
    - Recently formed a leadership structure
    - Formalized bylaws and policy
- Education and outreach
    - Partnerships with [SERC](http://serc.carleton.edu/index.html), [Flyover Country](http://fc.umn.edu/), etc.
