# Diatom & Water Chemistry Workshop Documents

This folder is intended to highlight our ability to work with two specific dataset types in Neotoma, diatoms and water chemistry data. This respository represents work contributed by a number of authors, to highlight methods in R to search for, download and analyze diatom data using the [neotoma2](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05561) R package.

The repository is a work in progress at this point in time. Key analytics include:

* Summarising counts and abundances
* Harmonizing taxa and water chemistry measurements
* Mapping distributions of measurements and diatom abundances
* Performing correlation analysis between diatom abundances and water chemistry measurements
