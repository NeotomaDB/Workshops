<p>Diatoms are excellent paleoecological indicators <span class="citation" data-cites="Dixit1992-ul smolstormerbook">[@Dixit1992-ul;@smolstormerbook]</span>. When we see changes in the relative abundance of diatom taxa over time they tell us something about how its environment changed. he simplest approach to using diatoms as indicators is to look at changes in abundance of an individual taxon. If we know the ecological characteristics of a taxon that changes in abundance, we may be able to say something about the nature, direction and magnitude of ecological change. The best way to quantify the ecological characteristics of taxa is to analyze relationships between surface-sample diatom counts and corresponding environmental data for a large number of lakes. A purpose of this document is to provide code and procedures for getting data from Neotoma in preparation for doing these analyses.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated approach for using diatoms is to quantify mathematical relationships between entire assemblages and environmental characteristics and use them to develop models to infer specific characteristics <span class="citation" data-cites="Juggins2012-nf Fritz2013-vk Wilson1996-hb battarbeeReference">[@Juggins2012-nf;@Fritz2013-vk;@Wilson1996-hb;@battarbeeReference]</span>. Neotoma offers the possibility of creating new calibration datasets by combining all or some of the existing aggregate datasets. Another purpose of this document is to help users to identify sites, samples and environmental data that can be used to construct new calibration datasets.</p>
<p>Input data for the code in this document is a file with diatom and water chemistry datasetids for over 40 surface sample aggregate datasets in the US and Canada <a href="data/drexekcrossreference.csv">link</a>. An Excel file with datasetids for individual aggregate datasets is maintained at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.</p>
<p>Some questions that users of this document may wish to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What surface sample datasets are available from Neotoma and where are the sites located?</li>
<li>What projects generated the data?</li>
<li>Which sets of sites might have the most consistent taxonomy and require the least amount of harmonization?<br>
</li>
<li>Which diatomists did counts for each aggregate dataset?</li>
<li>Which sites have environmental characteristics most similar to the ones I am studying? What are the average water chemistry characteristics of each aggregate dataset?</li>
<li>What is the distribution of sites with specific taxa that I might be interested in? Which sites are the most similar to the ones I am studying? (geographically and environmentally)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="load-data">Load Data</h2>
<p>To first work with this data we need to identify the specific sites and datasets within Neotoma that we’re interested in working with. We can either search for the data using the <code>neotoma2</code> R package (the <code>get_sites</code> and <code>get_datasets</code> functions allow us to perform searches) or we can use a pre-compiled set of records from a spreadsheet. In this example, we have a spreadsheet, saved as a CSV:</p>

<p>With the unique IDs for both the diatom and water chemistry datasets we can call <code>get_datasets()</code> passing along a dataset ID to Neotoma, to get back the record’s associated metadata. This will include the site location and also metadata about the age range of the records and information about the researchers associated with the data analysis. Notably here, the “dataset” metadata does not include the actual counts for individual diatom taxa, or (in the case of water chemistry) the measurements of individual water chemistry elements. This is beacuse people often want to download a large number of records at one time.</p>
<p>By splitting our calls to Neotoma into:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>get_sites()</code> (just spatial metadata)</li>
<li><code>get_datasets()</code> (spatial + dataset type and some age metadata)</li>
<li><code>get_downloads()</code> (all the above plus the actual sample data)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can help make some of our workflows a bit faster because we often want to filter based on age ranges, or spatial features before we filter based on species or chemical properties within records.</p>
<p>Here we’re first going to download the dataset metadata, using the unique dataset IDs from our table. Two things to note about the following calls:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We wrap the call to the column <code>drexel$diatomdatasetid</code> in <code>na.omit()</code> to remove all the missing values from the column.</li>
<li>We use <code>all_data = TRUE</code> to ensure that all of the record IDs we pass are downloaded. By default the API returns 25 records at a time to help reduce the chance of inadvertently pulling in a large number of records.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, even <code>dataset</code> records coming from Neotoma are relatively large, so there is some element of dataset processing that takes time. Sometimes we want to test our work using a small subset of the data first (by setting <code>all_data = FALSE</code>) before we run everything.</p>

<p>Diatom aggregate surface sample calibration dataset distribution in North America. There are over 2000 sites ranging from Arctic Canada to the southern United States. Most aggregate datasets are limited to relatively small regions (e.g., states). Some datasets are large scale (e.g., EPA 20R07 National Lake assessment). Observing the current site and aggregate dataset distributions aid in helping create new calibration datasets.</p>
