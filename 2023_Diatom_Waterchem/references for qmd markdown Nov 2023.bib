  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to
               20(th)-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these
               ecological transformations compare with alpine and
               montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore,
               it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including
               atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr),
               have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based
               paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for
               retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote
               lake ecosystems. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We synthesized
               52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North
               America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and
               altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic
               (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems.
               Diatom compositional turnover (beta-diversity) during the 20(th)
               century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence
               Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with
               sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19(th) century and
               the prior approximately 250 years (Little Ice Age). For both
               arctic and alpine lakes, beta-diversity during the 20(th)
               century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years,
               and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no
               correlation is apparent between 20(th)-century diatom
               beta-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter
               (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH,
               conductivity, [NO(3)(-)], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer
               and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends
               1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to
               summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to
               lake pH, lake:catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and
               recent temperature trends. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The
               ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial
               environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal
               concentrations of sites with elevated 20(th)-century diatom
               beta-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing
               most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr
               deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to
               shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene,
               particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to
               intersect geographically.",

  abstract  = "Quantitative reconstructions from biological proxies have
               revolutionised palaeolimnology but the methodology is not
               without problems. The most important of these result from
               attempts to reconstruct non-causal environmental variables and
               from the effects of secondary variables. Non-causal variables
               act as surrogates for often unknown or unquantified ecological
               factors and the method assumes that these relationships are
               invariant in space and time. This assumption is almost never met
               and examples of diatom models for water depth and summer
               temperature demonstrate how violation leads to spurious and
               misleading reconstructions. In addition, comparison of published
               species optima indicate that a number of models have little or
               no predictive power outside their current spatial setting.
               Finally, experiments using simulated training sets of known
               properties demonstrate how changes in secondary ``nuisance''
               variables can lead to large, consistent, and interpretable
               trends in a reconstruction that are completely spurious and
               independent of any real change in the reconstructed variable.
               These problems pervade many quantitative reconstructions in
               palaeolimnology and other disciplines. Palaeoecologists must
               give greater attention to what can and cannot be reconstructed
               and explicitly address the dangers of reconstructing surrogate
               and confounded variables if our reconstructions are to remain
               credible.",

  abstract  = "Sediment diatoms are widely used to track environmental
               histories of lakes and their watersheds, but merging datasets
               generated by different researchers for further large-scale
               studies is challenging because of taxonomic discrepancies caused
               by rapidly evolving diatom nomenclature and taxonomic concepts.
               We collated five datasets of lake sediment diatoms from the
               Northeastern USA using a harmonization process which included
               updating synonyms, tracking the identity of inconsistently
               identified taxa, and grouping those that could not be resolved
               taxonomically. Each harmonization step led to an increase in
               variation explained by environmental variables and a parallel
               reduction of variation attributable to taxonomic inconsistency.
               To maximize future use of the data and underlying specimens we
               provide the original and harmonized counts for 1327 core samples
               from 607 lakes, name translation schemes, sample metadata,

               1154 morphological operational taxonomic units. Post-hoc
               harmonization enables data quality control when other approaches
