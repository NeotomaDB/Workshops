## 1. Introduction

This document is intended to act as a primer for the use of the new Neotoma R package, `neotoma2`.  Some users may be working with this document as part of a workshop for which there is a Binder instance. The Binder instance will run RStudio in your browser, with all the required packages installed.

If you are using this workflow on its own, or want to use the package directly, [the `neotoma2` package](https://github.com/NeotomaDB/neotoma2) is available from GitHub and can be installed in R using the `devtools` package by running:

```r
devtools::install_github('NeotomaDB/neotoma2')
library(neotoma2)
```

This workshop will also require other packages. To maintain the flow of this document we've placed instructions at the end of the document in the section labelled "[Installing packages on your own](#localinstall)".

## 2. Learning Goals

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Search for sites using site names and geographic parameters -- [Site Searches](#3-site-searches)
* Filter results using temporal and spatial parameters -- [Filter Results](#33-filter-records-tabset)
* Obtain sample information for the selected datasets -- [Sample Information](#34-pulling-in-sample-data)
* Perform basic analysis including the use of climate data from rasters -- [Basic Analysis](#4-simple-analytics)

### 2.1. Getting Help with Neotoma

If you're planning on working with Neotoma, please join us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/neotomadb/shared_invite/zt-cvsv53ep-wjGeCTkq7IhP6eUNA9NxYQ) where we manage a channel specifically for questions about the R package. You may also wish to join our Google Groups mailing list, please [contact us](mailto:neotoma-contact@googlegroups.com) to be added.

### 2.2 Understanding Data Structures in Neotoma

Data in the Neotoma database itself is structured as a set of linked relationships to express the different elements of paleoecological analysis: space and time, raw data, scientific methods and data models. Because paleoecology is such a broad discipline these relationships can be complex, and as such, the database itself is highly structured. If you want to better understand concepts within the database, you can read the [Neotoma Database Manual](https://open.neotomadb.org/manual), or take a look at [the database schema itself](https://open.neotomadb.org/dbschema).

In this workshop we want to highlight two key structural concepts:
  
  1. The way data is structured conceptually within Neotoma (Sites, Collection Units and Datasets).
  2. The way that this structure is adapted within the `neotoma2` R package.

### 2.2.1 Data Structure in the Neotoma Database

![*The structure of sites, collection units and datasets within Neotoma. A site contains one or more collection units. Chronologies are associated with collection units. Data of a common type (pollen, diatoms, vertebrate fauna) are assigned to a dataset.](images/sitecollunitdataset.png){width=100%}

Data in Neotoma is associated with sites -- specific locations with lat/long coordinates.

Within a **site**, there may be one or more [**collection units**](https://open.neotomadb.org/manual/dataset-collection-related-tables-1.html#CollectionUnits) -- locations at which samples are physically collected within the site. For example, an archaeological **site** may have one or more **collection units**, pits within a broader dig site; a pollen sampling **site** on a lake may have multiple **collection units** -- core sites within the lake basin. Collection units may have higher resolution GPS locations than the site location, but are considered to be part of the broader site.\

Within a **collection unit** data is collected at various [**analysis units**]. Any data sampled within an analysis unit is grouped by data type and aggregated into a sample. The set of samples for a collection unit of a particular data type is then assigned to a dataset.

### 2.2.2 Data Structures in `neotoma2`

![Neotoma R Package diagram. Each box represents a data class within the package. Individual boxes show the class object, its name, its properties, and functions that can be applied to those objects. For example, a `sites` object has a property `sites`, that is a list. The function `plotLeaflet()` can be used on a `sites` object.](images/neotomaUML_as.svg)

If we look at the [UML diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) for the objects in the `neotoma2` R package we can see that the data structure generally mimics the structure within the database itself.  As we will see in the [Site Searches section](#3-site-searches), we can search for these objects, and begin to manipulate them (in the [Simple Analysis section](#4-simple-analytics)).

It is important to note: *within the `neotoma2` R package, most objects are `sites` objects, they just contain more or less data*.  There are a set of functions that can operate on `sites`.  As we add to `sites` objects, using `get_datasets()` or `get_downloads()`, we are able to use more of these helper functions.

## 3. Site Searches

### 3.1. `get_sites()`

There are several ways to find sites in `neotoma2`, but we think of `sites` as being spatial objects primarily. They have names, locations, and are found within the context of geopolitical units, but within the API and the package, the site itself does not have associated information about taxa, dataset types or ages.  It is simply the container into which we add that information.  So, when we search for sites we can search by:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| sitename | A valid site name (case insensitive) using `%` as a wildcard. |
| siteid | A unique numeric site id from the Neotoma Database |
| loc | A bounding box vector, geoJSON or WKT string. |
| altmin | Lower altitude bound for sites. |
| altmax | Upper altitude bound for site locations. |
| database | The constituent database from which the records are pulled. |
| datasettype | The kind of dataset (see `get_tables(datasettypes)`) |
| datasetid | Unique numeric dataset identifier in Neotoma |
| doi | A valid dataset DOI in Neotoma |
| gpid | A unique numeric identifier, or text string identifying a geopolitical unit in Neotoma |
| keywords | Unique sample keywords for records in Neotoma. |
| contacts | A name or numeric id for individuals associuated with sites. |
| taxa | Unique numeric identifiers or taxon names associated with sites. |

All sites in Neotoma contain one or more datasets. It's worth noting that the results of these search parameters may be slightly unexpected. For example, searching for sites by sitename, latitude, or altitude will return all of the datasets for the particular site. Searching for terms such as datasettype, datasetid or taxa will return the site, but the only datasets returned will be those matching the dataset-specific search terms. We'll see this later.

#### 3.1.1. Site names: `sitename="%Cheruvu%"` {.tabset}

We may know exactly what site we're looking for ("Lac Mouton"), or have an approximate guess for the site name (for example, we know it's something like "Lait Lake", or "Lac du Lait", but we're not sure how it was entered specifically), or we may want to search all sites that have a specific term, for example, *Cheruvu* is the Telugu term for a lake or pond. If we are looking for lakes in a particular part of India we may want to search using this term.

We use the general format: `get_sites(sitename="XXXXX")` for searching by name.

PostgreSQL (and the API) uses the percent sign as a wildcard.  So `"%Cheruvu%"` would pick up ["Potapuram Cheruvu"](https://data.neotomadb.org/12018) for us (and would pick up "Durgam Cheruvu" and "Pedda Cheruvu" if records for these lakes existed).  Note that the search query is also case insensitive, so you could simply write `"%cheruvu%"`.

##### 3.1.1.1. Code


```r
pop_sites <- neotoma2::get_sites(sitename = "%Cheruvu%")
plotLeaflet(pop_sites)
```

```

#### 3.1.2. Location: `loc=c()` {.tabset}

The `neotoma` package used a bounding box for locations, structured as a vector of latitude and longitude values: `c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.  The `neotoma2` R package supports both this simple bounding box, but also more complex spatial objects, using the [`sf` package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). Using the `sf` package allows us to more easily work with raster and polygon data in R, and to select sites from more complex spatial objects.  The `loc` parameter works with the simple vector, [WKT](https://arthur-e.github.io/Wicket/sandbox-gmaps3.html), [geoJSON](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) objects and native `sf` objects in R.

Looking for sites using a location. We're putting a rough representations of a region stretching from East Africa through South Asia.  To work with this spatial object in R we also transformed the `geoJSON` element to an object for the `sf` package.  There are many other tools to work with spatial objects in R. Regardless of how you get the data into R, `neotoma2` works with almost all objects in the `sf` package.


```r
geoJSON <- '{"coordinates": 
  [[
    [20.59, 34.22],
    [16.19, 30.57],
    [17.75, 19.51],
    [43.63, 10.59],
    [85.47, 2.15],
    [107.32, 8.90],
    [107.39, 27.31],
    [67.87, 37.84],
    [20.59, 34.22]
  ]],
  "type": "Polygon"}'

sa_sf <- geojsonsf::geojson_sf(geoJSON)

sa_sites <- neotoma2::get_sites(loc = sa_sf, all_data = TRUE)
```

You can always simply `plot()` the `sites` objects, but you will lose some of the geographic context.  The `plotLeaflet()` function returns a `leaflet()` map, and allows you to further customize it, or add additional spatial data (like our original bounding polygon, `sa_sf`, which works directly with the R `leaflet` package):

##### 3.1.2.1. Code


```r
neotoma2::plotLeaflet(sa_sites) %>% 
  leaflet::addPolygons(map = ., 
                       data = sa_sf, 
                       color = "green")
```

In addition to domestic architecture, the excavators uncovered two seemingly ritual features, i.e., a pit containing the articulated remains of two cattle (Hill et al. 2016) and a uniquely and well-constructed building (building 1) containing the remains of several gazelle feet as well as a human foot (Price et al. 2016). Archaeobotanical and faunal data from Marj Rabba indicate a mixed agricultural economy. Among the plant remains, wheat and barley predominated, followed by lentils, olives, and peas (Graham 2018). The animal remains (Table 1) show a predominance of domestic livestock.

It lies south of the Alykos River (at a mean elevation of 280 m asl), at the interface of the Troodos igneous rocks and the sedimentary\r\nchalks and limestones of the central lowlands, providing access both to the copper sulphide ore deposits of the Troodos Pillow Lavas, and to themore fertile, agricultural soils of the central plain. Climatically, all of\r\nthe region around Marki Alonia is semi-arid and average yearly precipitation in the site area is only 300�400 mm per year (Xenophontos,\r\n1996; Michaelides et al., 2009). On this basis, and considering the small remnants of native vegetation, it has been proposed that the general vegetation of the Marki area during the Early and Middle Bronze Age likely consisted of low maquis on the pillow lavas and maquis and\r\ngarrigue on the chalk cliffs and hills, with riparian scrub growing along the Alykos River (Adams and Simmons, 1996a). From 1990 to 2000, excavations by La Trobe University (Australia) exposed about 2000 m2 of the settlement and demonstrated some 500 years of continuous occupation, from the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (Philia facies) through to Middle Cypriot II (ca. 2400 to 1850 BCE), with nine architectural phases (A�I) evidenced within the stratigraphic sequence (Frankel and Webb, 2006a, 2006b).Zooarchaeological analyses revealed that about half of the animal bones recovered during excavation were from sheep and goats, followed by cattle and fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica). The remainder of the assemblage consists of pigs, equid (most likely donkeys) and carnivores, particularly dogs and foxes.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28207>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Bir Atrun<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Lake surrounded by low bedrock hills.

It is situated 25 km northeast of Paphos, at approximately 480 meters above sea level (masl) in the foothills of the Troodos Mountains. It overlooks the Ezousas River. Excavations have been completed and a monograph is currently being written about the findings. Approximately 300 sq m have been excavated, producing one of the largest faunal assemblages on the island. The assemblage is comprised of Mesopotamian fallow deer, followed by pig and caprine. There are also small quantities of cattle remains (less than 2%). Dog and cat, presumably domesticated, are also represented in very small numbers. Radiocarbon determinations suggest a site occupation of around 400-500 years (7956-7058 cal BC). Two of the three Near Eastern founder cereal crops are present: einkorn and hulled barley. Pulses and wild taxa, such as pistachio and pea/vetch, were also recovered. Material artifacts recovered include: a large chipped stone assemblage (around 300,000 pieces); numerous ground stone implements; picrolite (local mineral whose color varies from light blue-green to dark olivegreen) ornaments; shell beads; and several circular/oval, cobbled structures, which would have required substantial labor investment in their construction and maintenance. Combined with the faunal and floral assemblage, all of these material artifacts and structures suggest that people were present at the site for at least part of the year (Lucas 2014; Lucas et al. 2012; Simmons 1998a, 1998b, 2009a, 2009b, 2010, 2012; Simmons et al. in press).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28519>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Albalid1<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Wetlands along the Arabian sea<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28521>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Oasis located 700 m east of the Dead Sea shore (northern basin)<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28701>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 1<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28894>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 2<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28895>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 3<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28896>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 4<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28897>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 5<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28898>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Palm Terrace site 6<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Phoenix oasis in desert<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=28899>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Petra<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> Petra, originally called Rekem by the Nabataeans (Retso 1999), is located in the eastern highlands of the Jordan Rift Valley (Figure 1). The geographic origin of the Nabataeans and the date that their tribal kingdom was established at Petra remains uncertain. The Greek Historian Diodorus in the 4th century A.D. describes the Nabataeans as nomads, giving the impression that at the time the Nabataeans lacked permanent dwellings (Schmid 2002). Over the following centuries, the Nabataeans gained wealth through trading incense and spices between the Mediterranean and South Arabia and Petra became a major center for trade, collecting taxes from caravans passing through the city (Fiema 2003). The increased interaction with international polities and intensified trade likely stimulated the increased sedentism of Nabataeans (Schmid 2002), who began building permanent structures at Petra in the 3rd to 2nd centuries B.C. (Graf et al. 2005; Graf et al. 2007). The city of Petra was a large urban center during the 1st century B.C. through 4th century A.D. The individuals investigated in this study come from the Petra North Ridge Project (PNRP), which consists of tombs that contain the remains of individuals thought to be non-elite city residents. Preliminary investigations of diet and disease (Canipe 2014; Appleton 2015) found that the non-elite adult residents of Petra suffered little from chronic infections or malnutrition and had a diet well-balanced between animal protein and C3 plants such as wheat, barley, fruits, and legumes.<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29355>Explorer Link<\/a>","<b>Baqah Valley Caves<\/b><br><b>Description:<\/b> The Baq'ah Valley is located 15 to 20 km NW of Amman.

It lies on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, c.15 kilometers northeast of the contemporary legionary fortress of el-Lejjun. A Latin building inscription still in situ over the main gate provides both its ancient name and a precise date of construction (293-305 CE). The fort is a classic quadriburgium (fort with four towers) built of local stone and forms a nearly square rectangle (c.56 m on a side, 0.31 ha) with large projecting rectangular towers (c.12 x 12 m) at each corner. The interior consists of an enclosed courtyard surrounded by ranges of rooms, originally of two stories, against the curtain wall. Excavation suggests that the fort was occuptied through the 4th and into the 5th centuries, after which it was abandoned (Parker, 2015).<br><a href=http://apps.neotomadb.org/explorer/?siteids=29369>Explorer Link<\/a>"],null,null,{"interactive":false,"permanent":false,"direction":"auto","opacity":1,"offset":[0,0],"textsize":"10px","textOnly":false,"className":"","sticky":true},null]},{"method":"addPolygons","args":[[[[{"lng":[20.59,16.19,17.75,43.63,85.47,107.32,107.39,67.87,20.59],"lat":[34.22,30.57,19.51,10.59,2.15,8.9,27.31,37.84,34.22]}]]],null,null,{"interactive":true,"className":"","stroke":true,"color":"green","weight":5,"opacity":0.5,"fill":true,"fillColor":"green","fillOpacity":0.2,"smoothFactor":1,"noClip":false},null,null,null,{"interactive":false,"permanent":false,"direction":"auto","opacity":1,"offset":[0,0],"textsize":"10px","textOnly":false,"className":"","sticky":true},null]}],"limits":{"lat":[2.15,37.84],"lng":[16.19,107.39]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

#### 3.1.3. Site Helpers {.tabset}

If we look at the [data structure diagram](#222-data-structures-in-neotoma2) for the objects in the `neotoma2` R package we can see that there are a set of functions that can operate on `sites`.  As we add to `sites` objects, using `get_datasets()` or `get_downloads()`, we are able to use more of these helper functions.

As it is, we can take advantage of functions like `summary()` to get a more complete sense of the types of data we have in `sa_sites`.  The following code gives the summary table. We do some R magic here to change the way the data is displayed (turning it into a `datatable()` object), but the main piece is the `summary()` call.

##### 3.1.3.1. Code


```r
# Give information about the sites themselves, site names &cetera.
neotoma2::summary(sa_sites)
# Give the unique identifiers for sites, collection units and datasets found at those sites.
neotoma2::getids(sa_sites)
```

```

In this document we list only the first 10 records (there are more, you can use `length(sa_sites)` to see how many datasets you've got). We can see that there are no chronologies associated with the `site` objects. This is because, at present, we have not pulled in the `dataset` information we need. In Neotoma, a chronology is associated with a collection unit (and that metadata is pulled by `get_datasets()` or `get_downloads()`). All we know from `get_sites()` are the kinds of datasets we have and the location of the sites that contain the datasets.

### 3.2. Searching for datasets: {.tabset}

We know that within Neotoma, collection units and datasets are contained within sites.  Similarly, a `sites` object contains `collectionunits` which contain `datasets`. From the table above we can see that some of the sites we've looked at contain pollen records, some contain geochronologic data and some contain other dataset types. We could write something like this: `table(summary(sa_sites)$types)` to see the different datasettypes and their counts.

With a `sites` object we can directly call `get_datasets()`, to pull in more metadata about the datasets.  The `get_datasets()` method also supports any of the search terms listed above in the [Site Search](#3-site-searches) section. At any time we can use `datasets()` to get more information about any datasets that a `sites` object may contain.  Compare the output of `datasets(sa_sites)` to the output of a similar call using the following:

#### 3.2.1. Code


```r
sa_datasets <- neotoma2::get_datasets(sa_sites, all_data = TRUE)

datasets(sa_datasets)
```

You can see that this provides information only about the specific dataset, not the site! For a more complete record we can join site information from `summary()` to dataset information using `datasets()` using the `getids()` function which links sites, and all the collection units and datasets they contain.

### 3.3. Filter Records {.tabset}
  
If we choose to pull in information about only a single dataset type, or if there is additional filtering we want to do before we download the data, we can use the `filter()` function.  For example, if we only want sedimentary pollen records (as opposed to pollen surface samples), and want records with known chronologies, we can filter by `datasettype` and by the presence of an `age_range_young`, which would indicate that there is a chronology that defines bounds for ages within the record.

#### 3.3.1. Code


```r
sa_records <- sa_datasets %>% 
  neotoma2::filter(datasettype == "pollen" & !is.na(age_range_young))

neotoma2::summary(sa_records)

# We've removed records, so the new object should be shorter than the original.
length(sa_records) < length(sa_datasets)
```

```

We can see now that the data table looks different (comparing it to the [table above](#322-result)), and there are fewer total sites. Again, there is no explicit chronology for these records, we need to pull down the complete download for these records, but we begin to get a sense of what kind of data we have.

### 3.4. Pulling in `sample()` data

Because sample data adds a lot of overhead (for this pollen data, the object that includes the dataset with samples is 20 times larger than the `dataset` alone), we try to call `get_downloads()` after we've done our preliminary filtering. After `get_datasets()` you have enough information to filter based on location, time bounds and dataset type. When we move to `get_download()` we can do more fine-tuned filtering at the analysis unit or taxon level.

The following call can take some time, but we've frozen the object as an RDS data file. You can run this command on your own, and let it run for a bit, or you can just load the object in.


```r
## This line is commented out because we've already run it for you.
## sa_dl <- sa_records %>% get_downloads(all_data = TRUE)
## saveRDS(sa_dl, "data/saDownload.RDS")
sa_dl <- readRDS("data/saDownload.RDS")
```

Once we've downloaded, we now have information for each site about all the associated collection units, the datasets, and, for each dataset, all the samples associated with the datasets.  To extract all the samples we can call:


```r
allSamp <- samples(sa_dl)
```

When we've done this, we get a `data.frame` that is 68823 rows long and 37 columns wide.  The reason the table is so wide is that we are returning data in a **long** format.  Each row contains all the information you should need to properly interpret it:


```
##  [1] "age"             "agetype"         "ageolder"        "ageyounger"     
##  [5] "chronologyid"    "chronologyname"  "units"           "value"          
##  [9] "context"         "element"         "taxonid"         "symmetry"       
## [13] "taxongroup"      "elementtype"     "variablename"    "ecologicalgroup"
## [17] "analysisunitid"  "sampleanalyst"   "sampleid"        "depth"          
## [21] "thickness"       "samplename"      "datasetid"       "database"       
## [25] "datasettype"     "age_range_old"   "age_range_young" "datasetnotes"   
## [29] "siteid"          "sitename"        "lat"             "long"           
## [33] "area"            "sitenotes"       "description"     "elev"           
## [37] "collunitid"
```

For some dataset types, or analyses some of these columns may not be needed, however, for other dataset types they may be critically important.  To allow the `neotoma2` package to be as useful as possible for the community we've included as many as we can.

#### 3.4.1. Extracting Taxa {.tabset}

If you want to know what taxa we have in the record you can use the helper function `taxa()` on the sites object. The `taxa()` function gives us, not only the unique taxa, but two additional columns, `sites` and `samples` that tell us how many sites the taxa appear in, and how many samples the taxa appear in, to help us better understand how common individual taxa are.

##### 3.4.1.1. Code


```r
neotomatx <- neotoma2::taxa(sa_dl)
```

#### 3.4.2. Understanding Taxonomies in Neotoma {-}

Taxonomies in Neotoma are not as straightforward as we might expect. Taxonomic identification in paleoecology can be complex, impacted by the morphology of the object we are trying to identify, the condition of the palynomorph, the expertise of the analyst, and may other conditions. You can read more about concepts of taxonomy within Neotoma in the Neotoma Manual's [section on Taxonomic concepts](https://open.neotomadb.org/manual/database-design-concepts.html#taxonomy-and-synonymy).

We use the unique identifiers (*e.g.*, `taxonid`, `siteid`, `analysisunitid`) throughout the package, since they help us to link between records. The `taxonid` values returned by the `taxa()` call can be linked to the `taxonid` column in the `samples()` table.  This allows us to build taxon harmonization tables if we choose to. You may also note that the `taxonname` is in the field `variablename`.  Individual sample counts are reported in Neotoma as [`variables`](https://open.neotomadb.org/manual/taxonomy-related-tables-1.html#Variables). A "variable" may be either a species, something like laboratory measurements, or a non-organic proxy, like charcoal or XRF measurements, and includes the units of measurement and the value.

#### 3.4.3. Simple Harmonization {.tabset}

Lets say we want all samples from which *Quercus* taxa have been reported to be grouped together into one pseudo-taxon called *Quercus-undiff*. **NOTE**, this is not an ecologically useful grouping, but used for illustration.

There are several ways of grouping taxa, either directly by exporting the file and editing each individual cell, or by creating an external "harmonization" table (which we did in the prior `neotoma` package).  First, lets look for how many different ways *Quercus* appears in these records:

Programmatically, we can harmonize taxon by taxon using matching and transformation. We're using `dplyr` type coding here to `mutate()` the column `variablename` so that any time we detect (`str_detect()`) a `variablename` that starts with `Quercus` (the `.*` represents a wildcard for any character [`.`], zero or more times [`*`]) we `replace()` it with the character string `"Quercus-undiff"`.  Note that this changes *Quercus* _only_ in the `allSamp` object, not in any of the downloaded objects. If we were to call `samples()` again, the taxonomy would return to its original form.

We're going to filter the ecological groups to include only *TRSH* (Trees & Shrubs).  More information about ecological groups is available from the [Neotoma Online Manual](https://open.neotomadb.org/manual/database-design-concepts.html#taxa-and-ecological-groups).


```r
# Change all instances of a Quercus-type taxon in the samples table
# to a fixed name "Quercus-undiff"
allSamp <- allSamp %>% 
  dplyr::filter(ecologicalgroup == "TRSH") %>%
  mutate(variablename = replace(variablename, 
                                stringr::str_detect(variablename, "Quercus.*"), 
                                "Quercus-undiff"))
```

There were originally 15 different taxa identified as being within the genus *Quercus* (including *Quercus*., *Quercus robur-type*, and *Quercus coccifera*). The above code reduces them all to a single taxonomic group *Quercus-undiff*.

If we want to have an artifact of our choices, we can use an external table.  For example, a table of pairs (what we want changed, and the name we want it replaced with) can be generated, and it can include regular expressions (if we choose):

| original | replacement |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Pinus.*  | Pinus-undiff |
| Picea.* | Picea-undiff |
| Tamarindus.* | Tamarindus-undiff |
| Quercus.*  | Quercus-undiff |
| ... | ... |

We can get the list of original names directly from the `taxa()` call, applied to a `sites` object that contains samples, and then export it using `write.csv()`.

##### 3.4.3.1. Code


```r
taxaplots <- taxa(sa_dl)
# Save the taxon list to file so we can edit it subsequently.
readr::write_csv(taxaplots, "data/mytaxontable.csv")
```

##### 3.4.3.2. Result

![**Figure**. A plot of the number of sites a taxon appears in, against the number of samples a taxon appears in.](simple_workflow_files/figure-html/PlotTaxonCounts-1.png)

#### 3.4.4. {-}

The plot is mostly for illustration, but we can see, as a sanity check, that the relationship is as we'd expect. There are a large number of taxa that are rarely present, and then several that are quite common.

You can then export either one of these tables and add a column with the counts, you could also add extra contextual information, such as the `ecologicalgroup` or `taxongroup` to help you out. Once you've cleaned up the translation table you can load it in, and then apply the transformation:


```r
translation <- readr::read_csv("data/taxontable.csv")
```

You can see we've changed some of the taxon names in the taxon table (don't look too far, I just did this as an example).  To replace the names in the `samples()` output, we'll join the two tables using an `inner_join()` (meaning the `variablename` must appear in both tables for the result to be included), and then we're going to select only those elements of the sample tables that are relevant to our later analysis:


```r
allSamp <- samples(sa_dl)

allSamp <- allSamp %>%
  inner_join(translation, by = c("variablename" = "variablename")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(!c("variablename")) %>% 
  group_by(siteid, sitename, harmonizedname,
           sampleid, units, age,
           agetype, depth, datasetid,
           long, lat) %>%
  summarise(value = sum(value), .groups='keep')
```

We now have a cleaner set of taxon names compared to the original table, both because of harmonization, and because we cleared out many of the non **TRSH** taxa from the harmonization table (the original `samples()` table is below).

## 4. Simple Analytics

### 4.1. Stratigraphic Plotting

We can use packages like `rioja` to do stratigraphic plotting for a single record, but first we need to do some different data management.  Although we could do harmonization again we're going to simply take the top ten most common taxa at a single site and plot them in a stratigraphic diagram.

We're using the `arrange()` call to sort by the number of times that the taxon appears within the core. This way we can take out samples and select the taxa that appear in the first ten rows of the `plottingTaxa` `data.frame`.


```r
# Get a particular site, in this case we are simply subsetting the
# `sa_dl` object:
plottingSite <- sa_dl[[1]]

# Select only pollen measured using NISP and convert to a "wide"
# table, using proportions. The first column will be "age".
# This turns our "long" table into a "wide" table:
counts <- plottingSite %>%
  samples() %>%
  toWide(ecologicalgroup = c("TRSH"),
         unit = c("NISP"),
         elementtypes = c("pollen"),
         groupby = "age",
         operation = "prop")
```

Hopefully the code is pretty straightforward. The `toWide()` function provides you with significant control over the taxa, units and other elements of your data before you get them into the wide matrix (`depth` by `taxon`) that most statistical tools such as the `vegan` package or `rioja` use.

To plot the data we can use `rioja`'s `strat.plot()`, sorting the taxa using weighted averaging scores (`wa.order`). I've also added a CONISS plot to the edge of the the plot, to show how the new *wide* data frame works with distance metric funcitons.


```r
# Perform constrained clustering:
clust <- rioja::chclust(dist(sqrt(counts)),
                        method = "coniss")

# Plot the stratigraphic plot, converting proportions to percentages:
plot <- rioja::strat.plot(counts[,-1] * 100, yvar = counts$age,
                  title = sa_dl[[1]]$sitename,
                  ylabel = "Calibrated Years BP",
                  xlabel = "Pollen (% of Trees and Shrubs)",
                  y.rev = TRUE,
                  clust = clust,
                  wa.order = "topleft",
                  scale.percent = TRUE)

rioja::addClustZone(plot, clust, 4, col = "red")
```

### 4.2. Change in Time Across Sites

We now have site information across our region, from East Africa to South East Asia, with samples, and with taxon names. I'm interested in looking at the distributions of taxa across time, and the proportion of their presence/absence. I'm going to pick the top 20 taxa (based on the number of times they appear in the records) and look at their distributions in time. We're going to use our harmonization table again, to clean up the taxon names.


```r
# Harmonize the sample names as above.
# Note that when we group we are treating `age` in a special way.
# If we multiply by 2, round to the nearest Thousandth, and then divide
# by two, we are effectively putting the data into 500 year bins:

# First, get the number of sites at which each taxon appears, within each
# 500 year bin:
taxaSitesByAge <- samples(sa_dl) %>%
  inner_join(translation, by = c("variablename" = "variablename")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(!c("variablename")) %>% 
  group_by(harmonizedname,
           "age" = round(age * 2, -3) / 2) %>%
  summarise(n = length(unique(siteid)), .groups = 'keep')

# Then get the total number of sites sampled within each 500 year bin:
samplesByAge <- samples(sa_dl) %>%
  inner_join(translation, by = c("variablename" = "variablename")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(!c("variablename")) %>% 
  group_by("age" = round(age * 2, -3) / 2) %>%
  summarise(samples = length(unique(siteid)), .groups = 'keep')

# Now get the proportion of sites at which each taxon appears:
groupbyage <- taxaSitesByAge %>%
  inner_join(samplesByAge, by = "age") %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n / samples)

# These lines of code give us the most common taxa
# in this dataset (their count of samples is in the top 5%)
mostCommon <- taxaSitesByAge %>%
  group_by(harmonizedname) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(n)) %>%
  filter(count > quantile(count, 0.95))

# The last thing to do is to select only some of the taxa:
subsetTaxa <- groupbyage %>% 
  filter(harmonizedname %in% mostCommon$harmonizedname)

# And then plot!
ggplot(subsetTaxa,
    aes(x = age, y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam') +
  facet_wrap(~harmonizedname) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(20000, 0), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_reverse(breaks = c(10000, 20000)) +
  xlab("Proportion of Sites with Taxon") +
  theme_bw()
```

![](simple_workflow_files/figure-html/summarizeByTime-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see clear patterns of change, and the smooths are modeled using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) in R, so we can have more or less control over the actual modeling using the `gam` or `mgcv` packages.  Depending on how we divide the data we can also look at shifts in altitude, latitude or longitude to better understand how species distributions and abundances changed over time in this region.

### 4.3. Distributions in Climate (July max temperature) from Rasters

We are often interested in the interaction between taxa and climate, assuming that time is a proxy for changing environments. The development of large-scale global datasets for climate has made it relatively straightforward to access data from the cloud in raster format.  R provides a number of tools (in the `sf` and `raster` packages) for managing spatial data, and providing support for spatial analysis of data.

The first step is taking our sample data and turning it into a spatial object using the `sf` package in R:


```r
modern <- samples(sa_dl) %>% 
  filter(age < 1000) %>% 
  filter(ecologicalgroup == "TRSH" & elementtype == "pollen" & units == "NISP")

spatial <- sf::st_as_sf(modern, 
                        coords = c("long", "lat"),
                        crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
```

The data is effectively the same, `sf` makes an object called `spatial` that is a `data.frame` with all the information from `samples()`, and a column (`geometry`) that contains the spatial data.

We can use the [`getData()` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/3.5-15/topics/getData) in the `raster` package to get climate data from WorldClim. The operations that follow here can be applied to any sort of raster data, provided it is loaded into R as a `raster` object.

Here we pull in the raster data, at a 10 minute resolution for the $T_{max}$ variable, maximum monthly temperature.  The raster itself has 12 layers, one for each month.  With the `extract()` function we just get information for the seventh month, July.  


```r
worldTmax <- raster::getData('worldclim', var = 'tmax', res = 10)
spatial$tmax7 <- raster::extract(worldTmax, spatial)[,7]
```

This adds a column to the `data.frame` `spatial`, that contains the maximum July temperature for each taxon at each site (all taxa at a site will share the same value).  We've already filtered to all UPHE taxa, but that still leaves us with 1 distinct names for the taxa.  We're going to use `dplyr`'s `mutate()` function to extract just the genus:


```r
spatial <- spatial %>%
  mutate(variablename = stringr::str_replace(variablename, "[[:punct:]]", " ")) %>% 
  mutate(variablename = stringr::word(variablename, 1)) %>% 
  group_by(variablename, siteid) %>% 
  summarise(tmax7 = max(tmax7), .groups = "keep") %>%
  group_by(variablename) %>% 
  filter(n() > 3)
```

#### 4.3.1. Setting the Background

We want to get the background distribution of July temperatures in South America, to plot our taxon distributions against by taking the maximum value of the temperature, however, since all values at the site are the same (because we used a spatial overlay) the maximum is the same as the actual July temperature at the site.


```r
maxsamp <- spatial %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(siteid) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(tmax7 = max(tmax7), .groups = 'keep')
```

Now we're going to plot it out, using `facet_wrap()` to plot each taxon in its own panel:


```r
ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = spatial,
               aes(x = round(tmax7 / 10, 0)), col = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~variablename) +
  geom_density(data = maxsamp, aes(x = tmax7 / 10)) +
  xlab("Maximum July Temperature") +
  ylab("Kernel Density")
```

## 5. Conclusion

So, we've done a lot in this example.  We've (1) searched for sites using site names and geographic parameters, (2) filtered results using temporal and spatial parameters, (3) obtained sample information for the selected datasets and (4) performed basic analysis including the use of climate data from rasters.  Hopefully you can use these examples as templates for your own future work, or as a building block for something new and cool!

## 6. Installing packages on your own {#localinstall}

We use several packages in this document, including `leaflet`, `sf` and others. We load the packages using the `pacman` package, which will automatically install the packages if they do not currently exist in your set of packages.


```r
options(warn = -1)
pacman::p_load(neotoma2, dplyr, ggplot2, sf, geojsonsf, leaflet, terra, DT)
```

Note that R is sensitive to the order in which packages are loaded.  Using `neotoma2::` tells R explicitly that you want to use the `neotoma2` package to run a particular function. So, for a function like `filter()`, which exists in other packages such as `dplyr`, you may see an error that looks like:

```bash
Error in UseMethod("filter") : 
  no applicable method for 'filter' applied to an object of class "sites"
```

In that case it's likely that the wrong package is trying to run `filter()`, and so explicitly adding `dplyr::` or `neotoma2::` in front of the function name (i.e., `neotoma2::filter()`)is good practice.
